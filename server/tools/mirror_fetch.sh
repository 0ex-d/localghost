# mirror_fetch.sh <set> <dir> [file] | --list <set> , fetch one set (or one file of it) from the LocalGhost mirror
# (https://www.localghost.ai/mirror, what it is and what it promises) into <dir>, every byte checked:
# the manifest's gpg signature against tools/mirror-key.asc, the site key committed in this repo and
# pinned here by fingerprint (never fetched at verify time: a key from the same server as the
# manifest proves nothing), then each file's SHA-256 against the manifest. Nothing unverified is
# ever given its real name; a failed download stays a hidden .part that the next run resumes. Files
# already in <dir> with the right hash are kept.
#
# Used at SETUP only (fetch_geo.sh, setup.sh for Go, setup_llama.sh, phone_model.sh): the box
# reaches the network while it holds nobody's data, never after. THE MIRROR IS THE ONLY SOURCE: a
# box never trusts a file that was not in a signed manifest, so the callers do not fall back to the
# upstream URLs (GHOST_MIRROR_UPSTREAM=1 is the operator's explicit, loud exception).
#
# The contract (the web repo's mirror/): MANIFEST.txt + MANIFEST.txt.asc at the base, three header
# lines (# LocalGhost Mirror Manifest, # Build: <build>, # Signed: <time>), a blank line, then
# "<sha256>  /<build>/<set>/<file>". Every set also holds NOTICE.txt and TERMS-<name>.txt, which
# come with any file of the set and stay beside it (the Gemma terms and the ODbL require it). A
# build directory never changes; the last two are kept, so a 404 on an old path means "re-read the
# manifest and carry on from the new build". A file whose recorded hash equals the manifest's is
# not downloaded, nor hashed again (a 33 GB extract is not re-read on every run). A download that
# does not match is deleted and fetched once more; a second mismatch fails that file.
#
# GHOST_MIRROR=<url> points elsewhere (a LAN copy over https, or file:///media/usb/mirror for a copy
# on a disk , MANIFEST.txt, its .asc and the build folders as the site has them), GHOST_MIRROR=off
# turns it off.
# Exit: 0 all fetched; 1 failed (the mirror unreachable, a bad signature, a file that would not
# match, the key file not the site key); 3 nothing to fetch here (GHOST_MIRROR=off, or the set / file
# is not published in this build). Either way the caller says so and stops; neither is a success.
