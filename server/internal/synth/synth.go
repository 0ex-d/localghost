// Package synth is the client contract for ghost.synthd, the memory-surfacing daemon. ghost.cued asks
// synthd "given this context, what memories are worth priming, and which (if any) clears the bar to
// surface". synthd owns the index and the retrieval; cued owns the WHEN and the WHETHER.
//
// HONEST STATE. synthd is not built , the indexing work is the next few months (see the "Before You
// Ask" Hard Truth). So this package ships a real interface and a STUB that returns nothing. cued is a
// full daemon running the four mechanisms for real; it just never gets a candidate back yet, so it
// correctly stays silent. When synthd exists, its client replaces the stub behind this same interface
// and cued starts surfacing without a line of cued changing.

// Query is the context cued hands synthd to prime against. It is deliberately a description of the

// context change); it commits to nothing and returns candidates ranked by synthd. cued then applies
// its own threshold and learning curve before anything reaches the user.
